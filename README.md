# Binanace_trading_simulation
This project is to about finding the optimal __Fee__ mechanism in the Exchange. RL agents acts as people under certain Fee policies. We observe how RL agents's behavior changes with Fee mechanism changes. Fee mechanism would change total trade volume and total fee. This project is maintained as Binance Fellowship.

Special thanks to providing nice trading environment https://github.com/Yvictor/TradingGym/

# Structure
1. [agent](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/agent)
    Stores trading agents and specify how to train the agents and how to use them. 
2. [data](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/data)
    Stores the historical data to train the agents
3. [env](https://github.com/deconlabs/Binanace_trading_simulation/tree/master/env)
    Stores the environment where fee different fee mechanisms applied

# Simulation Method
 1. Train RL agents using [trading gym](https://github.com/Yvictor/TradingGym/). 

 2. Transfer agents to different environments where different fee mechanism is applied. 
 Agents will trained again for 500 episodes more to adapt to each environment. Also, differentiate agents by varying risk_aversion ratio so that some agents prefer risk while others not.

 3. Observe how agents behave in each environment. Especially watch the total_volume and total_fee from each environment. Derive insights from the observation what characteristics of fee mechanism makes the difference.


# Future Plan
[]Provide environment where Limit order available -> lagged matching available to reflect more realistic trading environment

# Adopted Fee mechanisms (Could be added more)
1. With no fee
2. 0.1% on every Purchase
3. Elastic fee depending on the trading volume contemporary( Fee increases when trading volume is high and vice versa)
4. Min(10$, 0.1% * purchase amount)
